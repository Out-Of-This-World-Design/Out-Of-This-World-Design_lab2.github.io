As of now, I have very basic knowledge of web development, so learning about all of the elements used in this lab was very enjoyable but also challenging. One particular struggle I faced was understanding 'flex' and 'grid'. I had to look at online references to understand what these elements were and how to use them. When trying to line up a 3-column grid at the top of my personal page, I ran into issues getting the text to align correctly within each section. I had to spend a bit of time scouring documentation to understand how to format divs within a grid before I could get it to work as I intended it to.

I ran into an issue where my profile picture at the top of my personal page was appearing behind the cloud image, so I had to research what a z-index was as well as how "position" in CSS worked to resolve it.

I believe I could have been better about reusing CSS elements from the main style sheet - I found that I wrote a lot of somewhat unique CSS classes to achieve the format I planned. Due to time constraints and a slight lack of team communication, I wasn't able to be as efficient with reusing CSS elements as I wanted to be. This is something I hope to put more emphasis on going forward.
