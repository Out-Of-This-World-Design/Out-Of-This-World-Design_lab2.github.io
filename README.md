** 5 HTML **
I really hate to say this but i've been working with html for 15 years and I've used almost every html tag out there.  There's only a a handful of html tags that i haven't used in a long time that relate to language formatting like <ruby>.  I've done most of the new stuff in html5 even <canvas> to create moving characters with javascript

** 5 CSS **
I used Invert() to flip the clouds instead of photoshopping this.  First time using this.
[Invert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/invert())

This was the only css tag that I found that I haven't used before.  I've worked with doing 3d effects and animations with css in the past. I'm gone through all off css grid and flexbox features.  I've done @media queries and even newer stuff like min(), max(), clamp().

** BONUSES: Fall Backs and Progressive Enhancements **

We used google fonts to help make our fonts match the theme we have.  Sans-seriff was used as a fall-back for older browsers.  We also used a regular background in addition to our linear gradients.
